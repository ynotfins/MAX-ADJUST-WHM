When a fire or flood causes damage to your home, the first step for most homeowners is to contact their insurance company. Once you report the incident, the insurance company sends an adjuster to assess the damage and determine how much compensation you'll receive. However, there's a significant issue with this process:

The adjuster **works for the insurance company**, not for you. Their main responsibility is to **save the company money**, not to ensure that you receive the full compensation necessary to restore your home to its original state.

### **What is AIG Private Client?**

AIG Private Client is a premium insurance provider that specializes in covering high-value homes and expensive possessions. They offer coverage for luxury properties and high-net-worth individuals who require extensive protection. While they may offer top-tier coverage on paper, when it comes time to file a claim, the reality may be quite different.

Their adjusters are specifically trained to **protect AIG's financial interests**, not yours. In many cases, they will go to great lengths to **deny or minimize your claim**. AIG adjusters might offer you compensation only for the damages you specifically mention, even though you might not be aware of all the things that are eligible for compensation. Essentially, they focus on reducing the payout rather than maximizing it for your benefit.
