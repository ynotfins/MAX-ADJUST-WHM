When disaster strikes, you expect your insurance to cover the damage. But Chubb's adjusters work to **save the company money**, not to get you paid. Their goal? **Minimize or deny your claim.**

### **The Truth About Chubb**

Chubb sells itself as a premium insurance provider. But when it's time to file a claim, you face delays, lowball offers, or outright denials. Their adjusters only pay for what you specifically mention, leaving out damages you may not realize are covered. The result? **You get less than you should.**
