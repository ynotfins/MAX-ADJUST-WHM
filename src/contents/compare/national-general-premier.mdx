When disaster strikesâ€”whether it's a fire, flood, or another unforeseen eventâ€”the first instinct of most homeowners is to call their insurance provider. With National General Premier, you might be lured by promises of exclusive, high-end coverage. However, when it comes time to file a claim, the reality can be starkly different.

The adjuster sent to assess your damage **is an employee of National General Premier**, not your personal advocate. Their priority? **Protecting the insurer's bottom line**, even if that means short-changing you on your rightful compensation.

### **What is National General Premier?**

National General Premier markets itself as a top-tier insurance solution tailored for homeowners who demand luxury coverage and comprehensive protection. They offer attractive policies that sound ideal on paper, especially for those with high-value homes and possessions. But when it comes to the claims process, there's a catch.

Much like other large insurers, National General Premier's adjusters are trained to **minimize your claim payout**. They might overlook damages you're entitled to or focus solely on what you've explicitly reportedâ€”often leaving out hidden losses that are just as critical to your recovery.

### **The Hidden Agenda Behind the Claims Process**

At National General Premier, the claims process is structured to save the company money. Their adjusters are incentivized to limit payouts by scrutinizing every detail and finding reasons to **reduce your settlement**. This means that, despite their glossy marketing, when disaster hits, you might find yourself with a payout that barely scratches the surface of your actual losses.
