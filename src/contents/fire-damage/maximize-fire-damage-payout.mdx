A fire can turn your life upside down in seconds. The damage is devastating, but the real frustration often comes later—when you realise your insurance company is dragging its feet, undervaluing your losses, or outright denying parts of your claim. The unfortunate truth is that insurance companies are businesses, and their priority is **paying out as little as possible**. If you don't know how to fight for what's yours, you could end up settling for far less than you actually need to rebuild.

That's where **Max Adjust** comes in. As public adjusters, we work **for you, not the insurance company**. Our job is to **assess, document, and negotiate** on your behalf to make sure you get the **maximum payout possible**. If you're handling a fire damage claim, here's what you need to do—and how we can help.

## **Start Your Claim Early, but Don't Rush a Settlement**

The sooner you report the fire to your insurance provider, the better. Waiting too long can **delay your claim** and even give your insurer a reason to question it. However, this doesn't mean you should rush into accepting the first settlement offer. Insurance companies often start with **lowball offers**, hoping homeowners will accept them without question. If you do, you could end up **thousands of dollars short** of what you actually need to rebuild.

At Max Adjust, we make sure your claim is **filed correctly from the start**, avoiding unnecessary delays and mistakes. More importantly, we **review every offer** from your insurance provider to ensure they're not undervaluing your losses. If they try to settle for less than what you're owed, we push back.

## **Document Everything—The Right Way**

The more evidence you have, the stronger your claim. Taking **clear photos and videos** of all fire damage is a good start, but it's not enough. You also need a **detailed inventory** of everything that was lost or damaged, including the estimated value of each item. Receipts, warranties, and bank statements can also help prove the worth of your belongings.

Many homeowners **underestimate their losses**, either because they forget certain items or don't realise how much it will actually cost to replace everything. Max Adjust conducts a **thorough assessment** of your property, ensuring that **nothing gets overlooked**. We use specialised tools to **identify hidden damage**—things like smoke infiltration, structural weakening, and electrical issues that insurers often try to ignore. By building a **bulletproof case** with **detailed evidence**, we make it harder for your insurer to underpay you.

## **Know What Your Policy Actually Covers**

Insurance policies are full of **fine print, exclusions, and technical jargon** designed to confuse homeowners. Many people assume their policy will cover everything, only to find out later that certain losses **aren't included** or that they have strict limits on certain types of claims. This is why **understanding your policy is crucial** before you accept any settlement.

At Max Adjust, we break down your policy in **plain English**, helping you understand exactly what you're entitled to. We identify **every possible coverage option** that applies to your situation, including **temporary housing expenses, personal property replacement, and additional living costs**. Insurers won't always tell you what you can claim—but we will.

## **Don't Let the Insurance Company Rush You**

Once you file a claim, your insurance company will likely send an **adjuster** to inspect the damage. This adjuster works for **them**, not you. Their job is to **minimise the payout**, often by **downplaying damages or overlooking certain losses**. They might also pressure you to accept a **quick settlement**, knowing that homeowners are desperate to move forward.

This is one of the biggest mistakes people make—accepting an offer too soon. If additional damage is discovered later, you may not be able to reopen the claim. Max Adjust ensures that **your claim is fully evaluated** before any agreements are made. We negotiate aggressively, using detailed documentation to back up **every dollar we request**. If your insurance company tries to **stall, deny, or reduce your payout**, we hold them accountable.

## **Keep Track of Additional Expenses**

Fire damage isn't just about property loss—it also affects **where you live, how you eat, and how much money you have to spend while repairs are being made**. Many insurance policies cover **temporary housing, food costs, and other living expenses**, but you need to **prove** these costs to get reimbursed.

We help track **every eligible expense**, ensuring that **nothing is left out of your claim**. Whether it's hotel stays, meals, or transportation costs, we make sure you're compensated for **every dollar you've had to spend due to the fire**.

## **Why Max Adjust is Your Best Bet for a Bigger Payout**
