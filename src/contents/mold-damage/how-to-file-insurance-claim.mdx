Filing an insurance claim for mold damage can be stressful. If you follow the right steps, you can protect your home and make sure your insurer covers the necessary repairs. Here’s how to do it.

### 1. Protect Your Health and Prevent Further Damage

Mold can be dangerous. If you notice mold growth, wear protective gear like gloves and masks. Avoid disturbing the mold, as it can release spores into the air. If possible, reduce moisture by using dehumidifiers or fixing leaks. The goal is to stop mold from spreading while keeping yourself safe.

### 2. Document Everything

Take clear photos and videos of all affected areas. Capture mold growth, water damage, and any structural issues. List damaged belongings and estimate their value. Keep any receipts for past mold treatments or water damage repairs. Detailed evidence helps maximize your claim.

### 3. Review Your Insurance Policy and Contact Your Provider

Check your policy to see if it covers mold damage. Some policies exclude mold unless it results from a covered event like a burst pipe or roof leak. If you’re unsure, ask your insurance company for clarification. When you report the mold damage, describe the issue clearly and follow their instructions.

### 4. File the Claim and Work with the Adjuster

Submit all required documents and evidence. Your insurer will send an adjuster to inspect the damage. Be prepared to show them everything. If they downplay the severity, push back with your documentation. You can also hire a public adjuster to negotiate on your behalf.

### 5. Keep Records and Follow Up

Save all emails, receipts, and repair estimates. Track every conversation with your insurer, noting names, dates, and details. If the process stalls, follow up regularly. Persistence helps keep your claim moving and increases your chances of a fair settlement.

By taking these steps, you can improve your chances of a successful mold damage claim and get the coverage you need to restore your home.
