Filing an insurance claim after a fire can feel overwhelming. There's a lot to handle—damage, paperwork, and trying to get life back to normal. But if you take things step by step, the process becomes much more manageable. Here's a simple guide to help you through it.

### 1. Make Sure Everyone is Safe and Secure the Property

Your safety comes first. Once you and your family are safe, do what you can to prevent further damage. That might mean boarding up windows, covering holes with tarps, or shutting off utilities. If you haven't already, contact the fire department and local authorities. Their official report will be important for your insurance claim.

### 2. Document Everything

Take as many photos and videos as possible. Capture the damage from different angles, both inside and outside the house. Make a list of damaged items, including their estimated value. If you have receipts or warranties, gather those too. The more evidence you have, the smoother the claims process will be.

### 3. Review Your Insurance Policy and Call Your Provider

Before you file a claim, check your policy to see what's covered, what your deductible is, and if there are any special rules for water damage claims. Then, contact your insurance provider to report the fire. Be clear and direct when explaining what happened, and follow any initial instructions they give you.

### 4. File the Claim and Work with the Adjuster

Submit your claim with all the required documents. Your insurance company will likely send an adjuster to inspect the damage. Be ready to answer their questions and provide any additional details they need. Keep track of every conversation you have with the insurance company—write down names, dates, and any instructions they give you.

### 5. Keep Records and Follow Up

Hold onto all receipts and invoices for repairs, temporary housing, or anything else related to the fire. If you discover additional damage later, document that too. Check in with your insurer regularly to keep things moving. The more organised and proactive you are, the faster things will get resolved.
